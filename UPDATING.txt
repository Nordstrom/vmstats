Things to know for updating:

From 2.0.1 to 2.1
- vmstats now uses TCP to send stats to graphite. Make sure Graphite is configured to use TCP.
vmstats.properties changes:
    - the ESX_STATS option went from being '1' as true to a 'true' - this needs to be manually changed
    - vmstats.properties now has a USE_FQDN option, which should be set to true if you want stats put into graphite as
        host_example_com instead of just host
    - The MAX_STAT_THREADS got renamed to MAX_VMSTAT_THREADS
    - A MAX_ESXSTAT_THREADS option got added. 2 is a good number to start with.
