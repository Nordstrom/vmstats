Version 2.1
- Replace my Graphite UDP code with a network framework code (Most likely TCP for the time being) - done
- Make the stats counter code in Main actually go and count stats
- Write FakeCarbon client so you can test without a graphite install - mostly done
- Write code to compare stats coming out of vmstats and stats coming into FakeCarbon
- Change IP from 1.1.1.1 to 1_1_1_1 - sense & configure via flags - done
- Change host.example.com to host_example_com - done
- Get the parent information for a VM - so it becomes vmstats.CLUSTER.vmname.stat...

Version 2.2+
- A better/new manager thread that will help with exception handling & keep track of various stats
- Figure out how to mock up the VMware web services so tests can run without an actual vCenter/ESX node
- With mock services, write unit tests
- Add back in sending to Graphite via TCP
- Add in sending to Graphite via AMQP
